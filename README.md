# HelpdeskDeFre

## Description

For our webdevelopment class (second year bachelor informatics) we needed to design an Angular 5.0 application based on an own idea. The only things that the application deffinatly needed to have was an Angular frontend, Express backend running on Node.JS and mongoDB as database (MEAN stack). I choose to develop a simple helpdesk, a bit like Stackoverflow. We also could add any extra things we wanted so I added a chat server with different chat rooms (socket.io), the ability to add an profile picture when creating an account and an admin module.
The application can be found here: https://helpdesk-frontend.herokuapp.com
The application is hosted on heroku as this was part of the assignment aswell. The frontend, backend and chatserver are all different heroku applications so you might need to refresh the frontend because the backend and chatserver go to sleep after not being used for a while.
If you want to clone this repository to host the application yourself you will first need to run "npm install" in the backend, frontend and chatserver folder. After this you need to run the "npm start" command in each folder to start the different applications.
